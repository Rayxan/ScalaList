# A simple Data Structure in Scala 
This tiny project contains some basic operations that are possible to do in a (ADT) Abstract Data Type, a Linear List structure.

Something important to be analised is that this ADT defines a multable List, a List that has operations like insert and delete, that doesn't update the List.
